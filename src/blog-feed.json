Regardless of whether content is in a feed or not, the original creator of the content has the right to restrict its use. While most people do feel that if content is in an RSS feed, it is available for syndication--that is not always the case. Various groups have made efforts to add namespaces which expand the tags used in RSS, to define whether the content is available for syndication. The two most notable namespaces that detail permissions are the Creative Commons extension and the Bloglines' Access extension. These two extensions are not yet widely supported so it is always best to check the terms of service associated with the feed or website to determine if the feed is available for syndication.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.feedforall.com/rss-quiz.htm\" target=\"_blank\" >A Quiz: Test Your RSS Smarts</a>",

Highly focused articles are often sought by wembasters. Why? Because content on the web is still king! In order to attract search engines and site visitors, webmasters rely heavily on providing new, innovative and fresh content. If the web site content is rich, visitors will come. If the website content is updated regularly, visitors will return. When evaluating a website's traffic it is easy to see that the low cost of syndicated content can increase a website's value. Sites that contain multiple pages related to a specific topic increase the likelihood of being 'found' when a variety of search phrases are used for that topic.<br />\n<br />\nBy creating a niche resource, webmasters are viewed as industry experts and their websites are more likely to receive incoming directory links. A number of publishers provide free content, the only stipulation being that the webmaster serving the content must include the author resource box. Webmasters utilizing free content can easily create portals teeming with themed content.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.feedforall.com/content-syndication.htm\" target=\"_blank\" >It is All About Content Syndication</a>",

          "description": "With all the vast amounts of information available on the web, it is becoming more and more difficult to sort through and find what you are looking for. RSS significantly lowers the signal-to-noise ratio. RSS has the unique ability to compile information and filter it, so you only see unique and relevant content. The information superhighway has become packed with content, and those familiar with technology are using RSS to filter the content, allowing them to drill down and access only the content they want, without having to wade through all the noise.<br />\n<br />\nThere are very few subjects or topics that do not currently have an RSS feed available. Perhaps it might be easier to ask what can not be published using RSS? RSS is a standard format to syndicate Internet content, not just blogs or podcasts, but any type of content. Podcasting clearly shows that feeds can be media-rich, and while podcasting is generally considered a medium for entertainment, the educational value of podcasting has not been lost on many educational institutions. The business community has been a little slower to embrace the power and importance of RSS as a communication medium, but industry leaders are gradually adopting it as a new and powerful method of communication. But back to the original point... RSS can deliver virtually any type of content, including spreadsheets, power point applications, database updates, video tutorial, and much more. The true value of RSS feeds is that the subscriber can review and evaluate the information at a time and place of their own choosing.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.feedforall.com/what-can-be-published-using-rss.htm\" target=\"_blank\" >What Can be Published Using RSS Feeds?</a>",

Regardless of whether content is in a feed or not, the original creator of the content has the right to restrict its use. While most people do feel that if content is in an RSS feed, it is available for syndication--that is not always the case. Various groups have made efforts to add namespaces which expand the tags used in RSS, to define whether the content is available for syndication. The two most notable namespaces that detail permissions are the Creative Commons extension and the Bloglines' Access extension.

They are often synchronized with certain actions, such as a door's slamming being accompanied by the appropriate noise. Sound effects may also be used in the background of a scene to create anticipation or other emotions.<br />\n<br />\nUnsurprisingly, the most realistic sound effects tend to be recordings of actual sounds. To create these sound effects, the actual sounds that are recorded may also be edited or enhanced; sometimes, the pitch, intensity, or another aspect of the sound may be altered using software. Sound effects may also be created entirely digitally by using software or sound equipment to recreate the intended effect. Such sound effects tend to be less realistic. Both of these kinds of stock sound effects are widely available and may be found in sound effect libraries. <br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://feedforall.com/production-and-use-sound-effects.htm\" target=\"_blank\" >Production and Use of the Sound Effects</a>",

This emerging method of audio file distribution has opened an array of marketing and communication opportunities to businesses. Currently, most who are familiar with podcasting are technically savvy, but it is clear that podcasting will be more than a passing fad as many businesses are adopting podcasting and employing it in unusual yet powerful ways. Podcasting can be used for talk shows, tutorials, music demos, educational training, stories, comedy clips, debates or even foreign language tutorials. <br />\n<br />\nWhile RSS has had the capacity to include audio files for a few years, only recently have entrepreneurs made the conceptual leap, taking advantage of the new power held within this communication medium. In reality, podcasters cover the gamut; some are professional broadcasters, while others are obvious amateurs. <br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.feedforall.com/how-podcasting-used.htm\" target=\"_blank\" >How Podcasting is Used</a>",

However, many new producers may not realize that sound effects have copyrights, and in many cases it is illegal to use a sound effect that you happen to find on the web without properly licensing it.<br />\n<br />\nMost podcasters and producers do not have the time or equipment to go out and record all the sound effects they may want to incorporate into their production. Podcasters are better off using royalty-free sound effects. Royalty-free sound effects are purchased, and there is no recurring fee for the use of the effect. The purchaser may use the sound effect(s) as often as required within the license terms and conditions, without paying for the use of the sound effect each time the effect is used. <br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.feedforall.com/power-of-audio.htm\" target=\"_blank\" >Sound Effects the Power of Audio</a>",

As a result, just about anyone can podcast, and the quality of podcasts is therefore highly variable; there are professional podcasts that rival professional broadcasts in quality, and there are amateur podcasts that can't even be heard clearly. For this reason, copyright infringement leeches, often unwittingly, into a number of podcasts. To produce a successful podcast, it is important to understand and respect Western copyright laws. To help ensure that these things are done, we have compiled some information about podcasts, music, and copyright law. <br />\n<a href=\"http://www.feedforall.com/podcasts-and-copyrights.htm\">http://www.feedforall.com/podcasts-and-copyrights.htm</a><br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<b>Why Over Sharing Might Be Hurting You</b><br />\nWe all know someone who divulges a little too much information on the Internet. Whether it's the friend who Instagrams every meal or the relative who constantly posts updates on how Fido's doing, this phenomenon seems well on its way to pervading all the social media we use. Maybe you have even caught yourself posting a bit too much. While something that everyone seems to be doing may appear harmless enough, oversharing can have some negative consequences of which all social media users should take note. <br />\n<a href=\"http://www.small-business-software.net/why-oversharing-might-be-hurting-you.htm\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.small-business-software.net/why-oversharing-might-be-hurting-you.htm</a><br />\n<br />\n <br />\n<b>10 Things Your Phone Can Do in Emergencies</b><br />\nWhile most smart phone owners are acquainted with the helpfulness of features such as navigation apps and mobile broadband, many people have yet to discover the array of uses they may put their phones to in the event of a true emergency. We have compiled a list of 10 things your phone can do in an emergency to shed light on this exciting and important realm of development:<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.notepage.net/learning-center/10-things-your-phone-can-do-in-emergencies.htm\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.notepage.net/learning-center/10-things-your-phone-can-do-in-emergencies.htm</a><br />\n<br />\n <br />\n<b>Crowdsourcing and Social Media: Their Real Impact </b><br />\nIt seems that our society is growing ever more dependent on social media; more and more people are joining social networking giants such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, and more such websites and applications are springing up to meet the rising demand for them. As society and culture continue this turn towards technology, so do the operations of society, especially through crowdsourcing. <br />\n<a href=\"http://www.small-business-software.net/crowd-sourcing.htm\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.small-business-software.net/crowd-sourcing.htm</a><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>Is It Time to Update Your Business Card</b><br />\nTo succeed in today's world, one must adapt to today's developments, including the ever-expanding implementation of technology.
